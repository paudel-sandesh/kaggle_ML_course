This means we need to be thoughtful about how and whether we rescale our features since we might get very different results depending on our choices. As a rule of thumb, if the features are already directly comparable (like a test result at different times), then you would *not* want to rescale. On the other hand, features that aren't on comparable scales (like height and weight) will usually benefit from rescaling. Sometimes, the choice won't be clear though. In that case, you should try to use common sense, remembering that features with larger values will be weighted more heavily.\n\n# 1) Scaling Features\n\nConsider the following sets of features.
